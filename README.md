[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/mattdifford/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate&stack=cms)

The instructions for setting up should be the same as on the original repo, I just added in the bits I needed so that I didn't have to do it every time
